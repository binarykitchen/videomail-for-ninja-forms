Record videos in Ninja Forms!

== Description ==
With this add-on recording and sending videos in WordPress *finally* comes true. No further coding required. Just install + configure a bit (like duration, width or enable audio etc) and that’s all. Wicked.

* Record from webcam, simple
* Allow *video* and *audio* inputs in your forms, wow!
* World first solution
* Very easy to add with Ninja Forms

All you need is the Ninja Forms plugin so that this extension can be added there.

Latest version (zip file) also can be downloaded for free anytime from GitHub:

More documentation on setup and configuration see:

== Installation ==
This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.
1. Upload the `videomail-for-ninja-forms` plugin folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Visit the ‘Ninja Forms’ menu item in your admin sidebar
4. Build a form using videomail

Probably you also want to whitelist additional domains besides localhost. See whitelisting under FAQ.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Donations? =
That would be awesome :) Scroll to bottom of https://videomail.io/faq

= Where is the documentation? =
Check out that pretty online PDF at [https://github.com/binarykitchen/videomail-for-ninja-forms/blob/master/doc/faq/videomail-for-ninja-forms-faq.pdf](https://github.com/binarykitchen/videomail-for-ninja-forms/blob/master/doc/faq/videomail-for-ninja-forms-faq.pdf)

= What options are there? =
That new recordable video field comes with many options you can configure yourself such as duration, width, audio on/off and much more.

Each option is explained well at bottom of this PDF file: [Videomail FAQ](https://github.com/binarykitchen/videomail-for-ninja-forms/tree/master/doc/faq/videomail-for-ninja-forms-faq.pdf)

= How does whitelisting work? =
For local development, everything will work right away because the localhost URL is already whitelisted on the videomail server.

But once you deploy your Wordpress site out in the wild, we will have to whitelist your production URL. For that, just submit a [Whitelist Request](https://videomail.io/whitelist). Very easy.

= Is there a live example? =
There is also the live site [videomail.io](https://videomail.io). Have a look and play.
You can see the videomail-client in action and use it right away for free, anytime, anywhere. Many people, especially Deafs and Sign Language users, already use it for their everyday communication.

= Can I use videomail outside of WordPress? =
Yes. There is a low level npm [videomail-client](https://github.com/binarykitchen/videomail-client) package. This WordPress plugin relies on it.

= Where is the support? =
To get help, just use any of these contacts at [https://binarykitchen.com](https://binarykitchen.com)

== Screenshots ==
1. There will be a new Ninja Form Fields in the common section called Videomail.
2. Once you have assembled a form and preview it, any browser will ask for webcam access first.
